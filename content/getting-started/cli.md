#### Introduction

If you prefer to manage your database migrations outside your application **without installing the .NET SDK**, the Evolve command-line interface (CLI) is the ideal tool. It is a standalone binary file with no external dependencies.

Currently, we provide Evolve.CLI binaries for the following x64 architecture:

- Windows
- Linux

#### Installation

**Download** the appropriate version for your platform from Evolve latest [releases](https://github.com/lecaillon/Evolve/releases/latest).

#### Command structure

The CLI uses the same commands and options than the .NET tool. Refer to that [section](/getting-started/tool/#command-structure) for more information.

#### Examples

Examples are also shared with the .NET tool. Refer to that [section](/getting-started/tool/#examples) for more information.

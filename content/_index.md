### What is Evolve ?

Evolve is a cross platform database migration tool, inspired by [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/).

Its purpose is to automate your database changes, and help keep those changes synchronized through all your environments and development teams.
This makes it an ideal tool for continuous integration / delivery.

Over all Evolve embraces simplicity. Every time you build or run your project, it will automatically ensure that your database is up-to-date.

Install it and forget it!
